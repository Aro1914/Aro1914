### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Emmanuel (He, Him, His), a Full Stack Developer with 3 years of experience in software development.  

I have gained significant experience in JavaScript, React.js, and Flask.  

I am very passionate about my profession, and as a quick study, I enjoy learning new skills to improve myself in my career path.  

With that said, I'm currently learning Python professionally for Backend development using Flask, SQLAlchemy, and Postgres Database through an ALX-T sponsored Full Stack Development Nanodegree scholarship on Udacity.ðŸ™‚  

I love working on backend projects involving business logic, and creating APIs, therefore I am looking to collaborate on any project that fall into that category, although I'm open to frontend projects too.ðŸ˜‡
